## Carbon capture
According to a 2008 report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States alone is responsible for 16.3% of total global CO2 emissions. In the United States, 40% of CO2 emissions are due to electricity generation from coal-fired power plants. If the current rate of CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere continues, the climate we live in today will no longer be viable in coming decades. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates the overall carbon emission can be reduced by 80-90% if conventional coal-fired plants are equipped with CO2 capture technology, such as adsorption-based processes. The main technological challenge remains to be the development of new adsorbent that selectively adsorb CO2 in the presence of N2, O2, and H2O.

Our group is working in this area to discover and design new adsorbent materials for carbon dioxide capture and separations.
