## CO<sub>2</sub> capture and utilization
The rapid rise of the atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is impacting the climate in unusual ways. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates the overall carbon emission can be reduced by 80-90% if conventional coal-fired plants are equipped with CO<sub>2</sub> capture technology, such as adsorption-based processes. Following the separation process, the captured CO<sub>2</sub> must be either geologically sequestered or transformed into high-value chemicals.
