Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of nanoporous crystalline materials that are synthesized in a building-block approach from inorganic secondary building units (SBUs) and organic linkers. The building-block paradigm to MOF synthesis creates opportunities for the synthesis of virtually unlimited number of nanoporous materials.

MOFs generally have high porosity and large surface area, making them ideal for applications in gas storage and separations, molecular catalysis, and chemical sensing. More recently, researchers are using MOFs in other applications, such as electrochemical energy storage and conversion, controlled drug delivery, and water harvesting in arid environment.

### Computation-Ready, Experimental Metal-organic framework (CoRE MOF) database

Thousands of the MOFs have been experimentally synthesized already since the discovery of the MOFs in the late 1990s. In practice, synthesizing and testing the large number of MOFs is not feasible, therefore, the high-throughput computational screening of a large database of MOFs can help expedite the experimental efforts.

Our group collaborates with other research groups around the world to collect, curate, and publish experimental MOF crystal information data. For more information, visit the link below.
