## Separation of hexane isomers
Separation of hexane isomers is an important separation task in petrochemical industry. More than 94% of the transportation energy spent in the U.S. in 2010 is based on gasoline, and hexane isomers are major components of the gasoline, comprising more than 10% by volume.

Both separations are challenging because traditional, energy-intensive separation process, such as distillation, is practically impossible due to closely matched vapor pressure between the isomers. Our group is working on design and development of new adsorbent materials that can efficiently separate hydrocarbons.
