<h3><li>Carbon dioxide capture and utilization</li></h3>
We use a multi-scale approach to find suitable adsorbent materials to capture CO<sub>2</sub> from coal-fired power plants.

Using electronic structure calculations, the group investigates catalysts which can transform CO<sub>2</sub> into useful chemicals, such as cyclic carbonate.
