<h3><li>Nanoporous Materials Genome</li></h3>
We collect, curate, and disseminate structures of nanoporous materials called metal-organic frameworks ("MOFs") reported in the literature. For more information, visit the link below.

<h4><a href="http://gregchung.github.io/CoRE-MOFs/">Computation-Ready, Experimental Metal-Organic Frameworks Database</a></h4>
<br>
<h3><li>Carbon Capture and Utilization</li></h3>
We use a multi-scale approach to find suitable technology to capture CO<sub>2</sub> from coal-fired power plants. The group also collaborates with experimentalists
to investigate chemical transformation of CO<sub>2</sub> into useful chemicals, such as cyclic carbonate.
